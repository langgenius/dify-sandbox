# Overview

Koffi is a fast and easy-to-use C FFI module for Node.js, featuring:

* Low-overhead and fast performance (see [benchmarks](https://koffi.dev/benchmarks))
* Support for primitive and aggregate data types (structs and fixed-size arrays), both by reference (pointer) and by value
* Javascript functions can be used as C callbacks (since 1.2.0)
* Well-tested code base for popular OS/architecture combinations

The following combinations of OS and architectures __are officially supported and tested__ at the moment:

ISA / OS           | Windows     | Linux    | macOS       | FreeBSD     | OpenBSD
------------------ | ----------- | -------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------
x86 (IA32) [^1]    | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes   | ⬜️ *N/A*    | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes
x86_64 (AMD64)     | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes   | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes
ARM32 LE [^2]      | ⬜️ *N/A*    | ✅ Yes   | ⬜️ *N/A*    | 🟨 Probably | 🟨 Probably
ARM64 (AArch64) LE | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes   | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes      | 🟨 Probably
RISC-V 64 [^3]     | ⬜️ *N/A*    | ✅ Yes   | ⬜️ *N/A*    | 🟨 Probably | 🟨 Probably

[^1]: The following call conventions are supported: cdecl, stdcall, MS fastcall, thiscall.
[^2]: The prebuilt binary uses the hard float ABI and expects a VFP coprocessor. Build from source to use Koffi with a different ABI (softfp, soft).
[^3]: The prebuilt binary uses the LP64D (double-precision float) ABI. The LP64 ABI is supported in theory if you build Koffi from source but this is untested. The LP64F ABI is not supported.
