## How to use

- edit the `test.py` code, add what python code you want to test
- then run: `go run cmd/test/syscall_dig/main.go` to get the required syscalls

If you want to check the syscall name by its number, you can run: `ausyscall ${syscall number}`. `ausyscall` is the cmd from `auditd` service.
